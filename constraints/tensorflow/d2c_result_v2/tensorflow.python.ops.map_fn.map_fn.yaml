constraints:
  back_prop:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) True enables support for back propagation.
    dtype:
    - bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  dtype:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) The output type(s) of `fn`.  If `fn` returns a structure of
      Tensors differing from the structure of `elems`, then `dtype` is not optional
      and must have the same structure as the output of `fn`.
    dtype:
    - tf.dtype
  elems:
    descp: A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be
      unpacked along their first dimension.  The nested sequence of the resulting
      slices will be applied to `fn`.
    dtype:
      - tf.tensor
    structure:
    - list
    tensor_t:
    - tf.tensor
  fn:
    descp: The callable to be performed.  It accepts one argument, which will have
      the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`.  Its output must have the same
      structure as `dtype` if one is provided, otherwise it must have the same structure
      as `elems`.
  infer_shape:
    default: 'True'
    descp: (optional) False disables tests for consistent output shapes.
    dtype:
    - bool
    ndim:
    - '0'
  name:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) Name prefix for the returned tensors.
    dtype:
      - string
  parallel_iterations:
    default: None
    descp: (optional) The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel. When graph
      building, the default value is 10. While executing eagerly, the default value
      is set to 1.
    dtype:
    - int
    ndim:
    - '0'
    range:
    - '[0,inf)'
  swap_memory:
    default: 'False'
    descp: (optional) True enables GPU-CPU memory swapping.
    dtype:
    - bool
    ndim:
    - '0'

  optional:
  - dtype
